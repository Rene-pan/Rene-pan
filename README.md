- 👋 Hi, I’m @Rene-pan
- 👀 I’m interested in User interface & User Experience Design + Game Designing!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning HTML, JavaScript and CSS so that I can bridge between designing using Figma and developing the designs on Visual Studio Code!
- 💞️ I’m looking to being able to work at renowned tech companies like Shopee, Razer, Google and more! Currently, managed to get into Razer as a UI Intern!
